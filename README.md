# Custom Bluetooth Car PCB

An Arduino Nano-based Bluetooth BLE motor driver circuit featuring an H-bridge (L293D ICs), voltage regulator, and manual control button. This project lets you wirelessly control a DC motor-driven vehicle with your phone or BLE-enabled device. The PCB is designed for reliability and easy integration into custom robotics, RC cars, and automation projects.

**Features:**
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) control via mobile app or BLE device
- H-bridge motor driver using L293D ICs for bidirectional control
- Integrated voltage regulation for safe, stable operation
- On-board button for manual override or backup control
- Compact, custom PCB optimized for Arduino Nano

**Applications:**
- Remote-controlled cars and robots
- DIY automation projects
- Educational electronics and robotics kits
